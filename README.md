# Hibernate Weekend Homework

Your task is to model relationships between classes and persist them via Hibernate.  Practice using annotations, table relationships and inheritance.  
We're looking for accurate representations, don't force the use of table relationships or inheritance if it doesn't make sense.

## MVP
Create CRUD functions through a DBHelper.

Here are some suggested scenarios:

### Hollywood
Model the relationships between Studios, Directors, Films, Actors/Actresses etc.


### Plays
Model the relationships between Authors, Plays, Characters, Theaters etc.


### Sports
Model the relationships between Competitions, Teams, Managers, Players etc.


## Extensions

Add further functionality to your model such as:
- Hollywood:
  - payActor (studio budget goes down, actors cash goes up)
  - show the amount of films a actor has appeared in by genre

- Plays:
  - calculate Theatres markup of plays put on
  - mark actors availability to perform in plays, signing up to a play changes this availability

- Sports:
  - sort teams in league on points total
  - play games which can increase teams points/knock teams out of competitions


### REMEMBER

TDD your models if appropriate.

Be creative, expand your model to your hearts content.  If you have any other ideas to model run it by an instructor first.
